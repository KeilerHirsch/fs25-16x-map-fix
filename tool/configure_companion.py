#  BigMap Optimizer -- VRAM auto-config for the companion mod
#  "The Man, The Mythos, The Legend : KeilerHirsch"   (GNU GPL v3 or later)
#
#  Detects this PC's graphics-card memory and writes the companion mod's
#  settings file, so the in-game texture-streaming budget is set from real
#  hardware with no manual editing. Cross-vendor (NVIDIA / AMD / Intel) via the
#  vram module. This is the "true auto" half of BigMap Optimizer: Lua cannot
#  read physical VRAM in-game, so the tool writes the value the mod then reads.
